- Once inside, look for a folder called `appdata_popstar` and open it.
- Once opened, you will see a folder called `2Take1Menu`, open it. 
- Once opened, search for a folder called `scripts` and open it.

- Download the files of this repo: https://github.com/AurelianSpodarec/GTA_UltimateMenu/archive/refs/heads/master.zip - and copy paste in the newly folder you just created
- Go inside the folder you created, go find a folder named `src` and copy cut `_dev.lua`
- Now, go back to folder `scripts` and put `_dev.lua` inside. 
- Rename the file to `UltimateMenu.lua`
